India is not only experiencing water scarcity in many places, it is also water rapidly becoming water stressed.
 
Exploitation, encroachment, and pollution of our water bodies (streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, wells, and ground water), that increase the water stress, have continued, largely unnoticed and unchecked. Unfortunately, many destructive acts do not adversely, or immediately, impact the actors causing the destruction. Similarly many constructive acts of restoration do not positively, or immediately, benefit the actors causing the restoration. This imbalance results in the failure to reinforce positive efforts and the proliferation of destructive actions.
 
It is important that both civil society and government agencies are able to recognise and react to the changes in the state/status of water bodies vis-a-vis their exploitation, encroachment, and pollution. It is important that they are able to work together to prevent the destructive acts and promote the constructive acts. It is also important that those causing destructive actions are able to immediately face the consequences of their destructive acts and those who undertake constructive acts are able to experience the rewards of their acts.
 
There is, therefore, a need to create information systems that will help change this information imbalance as one of the important means to restore and protect our water bodies. We are, therefore, proposing the development of information systems, websites, and/or mobile applications that can be deployed across the country to allow civil society and government to work together and address this imbalance and be able to work together towards protecting and restoring the water bodies.

We are proposing information systems to identify the actors, the information driving their actions and alternate information necessary to prevent destructive actions and promote constructive actions relating to exploitation, encrachment and pollution. This project will initiate a set of specifications and proto-types of information systems, websites, and/or mobile applications, strategies and action plans to crowdsource their development, and strategies and action plans to cause their widespread use by civil society and governments.
